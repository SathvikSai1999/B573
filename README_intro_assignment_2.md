## Purpose of Assignment 2

This assignment involves working with a DNA sequence file from chromosome 1 (chr1_GL383518v1_alt). The tasks progress as follows:

1. Basic Sequence Manipulation like
   1.1. Reading the sequence from the file and Extracting specific letters from the sequence.
   1.2. Creating a script to generate the reverse complement of the sequence, ensuring correct nucleotide substitutions (Watson-Crick base pairing).

2. Accessing and displaying parts of the reverse complement sequence.
   2.1. Kilobase-Level Analysis
   2.2. Constructing a nested dictionary to store nucleotide counts within each kilobase (1000-nucleotide segment) of the sequence.
